### Basics of quantitative investigation,Research Design
--

### Simply focussing statistics and techniques:  Miss the forest for the trees 
--

### Introduction to Data and exploring it with R
--

###  thinking clearly with data is very important ,once thinking is focused, techniques will follow 
--

### Learning R for making sense of data: real data based case studies
--

#### UN Voting data, Punjab Tax data (Messy vs tidy), WHO, Gapminder, nycflights,bikes,cia_factbook, wvs or if someone from you would like to shar it.

## Observartional Studies

### Controlled studies not the same as observational
#### - observationsl studies: its the subjects who assign themselves to different groups: the investigator watch just what happens
####- Controlled : investigator decides who to be in control group and who to will be in treatment group

### Control has two senses
#### - a control is a subject who did not get the treatment:
#### - a controlled experiment is a study where the investigators decides who will be in the treatment group and who will not.

#### Smoking and lungs cancer 
#### Main issue: was the control group really similar to the treatment group- apart from the exposure of interest?
### Statisticians talk about controlling for confounding factors in an observational studies. This is a third word of the use control.
---
## Examples
### The Clofibrate trial
### Pellagara
### Cervical cancer and cicumcision
### Ultrasound and low birthweight
### The Samaritan and suicide
