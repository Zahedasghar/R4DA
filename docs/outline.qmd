## Course Overview

This worksho is designed to introduce [practitioners to focus on research design and data analytics]{.yellow}, [thinking clearly with data]{.yellow} and learn to analyze data apply techniques through learning by doing . Philosophy of the workshop will be to enable participants doing exploratory data analytics by mastering concepts through computer assisted tools. [Main software for the course will be R]{.yellow}. During these three days we will

-   Emphasis on learning how to deal with data issues using R.

-   Working as a learning community to improve data analytics skills necessary in analyzing data.

## Workshop Objectives

All efforts will be made to learn through hands-on practice using real-world data and problems in a wide range of fields [economics, business analytics, psychology, sociology, education, and public health]{.yellow}. How to write [beautiful documents/reports and awesome presentations in R]{.yellow} using [Quarto]{.yellow} will also be introduced which will increase participants productivity manifold.

## This workshop is about

-   learning data analytics and modeling tools with labs and hands on practice.

-   critical reasoning with data and discussion about evidence based decisioin making.

-   Differentiating : opinion, anecdotes and hard core evidence

-   All slides, codes, notes, data and all related data sets will be provided to all the participants.

-   Learning how to create beautiful presentations, documents and writing research papers using R.

> ```         
> One can't learn all everything in 3 days time but objective is enabling beginners to move on data analytics learning path while taking professionals to next ladder from their current level of knowledge.

## Data Science

-   [You go into data analysis with the tools you know, not the tools you need]{.hi}

-   These 3 days are all about giving you the tools you need

    -   Admittedly, a bit before you know what you need them *for*

-   We will extend them as we learn specific models

## R

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Free** and **open source**

-   A very large community

    -   Written by statisticians for statistics
    -   Most packages are written for `R` first

-   Can handle virtually any data format

-   Makes replication easy

-   Can integrate into documents (with `Quarto`)

-   R is a *language* so it can do *everything* :-)
