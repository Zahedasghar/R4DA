# Workshop Overview
This workshop is designed for participants in economics and social sciences interested in developing hands-on skills in data analysis using R. Sessions will run for 2 hours weekly across two days (Friday and Saturday, 6-8 PM). The workshop will focus on practical activities with guided facilitation for online learning.

## Introduction {#intro}

## Workshop Objectives {##workshop-objectives}

- Develop skills in data handling, merging, and cleaning.
- Build competence in descriptive statistics, visualizations, and balance tables.
- Apply regression techniques like OLS, Logit/Probit, IV, and Difference-in-Differences.
- Encourage peer collaboration and hands-on data analysis.
