## What can R do for you?
## R is a popular language & platform for data science & statistical computing. It is:

### open source
### expanding (increasing capabilities through add-ons)
### able to open almost any data format
### able to scrape data from the web
### a decent tool for data wrangling
### popular in industry & academia
### pretty old ("born" 1976...)
---
## But R also:
- is a slightly awkward language for those with programming experience
has a steep learning curve
- requires a willingness to write code and use scripts (cf. Tableau & co.)
is less general than Python (but a bit easier to use for advanced statistical computing)
---

###  Why R in a Social Science, Humanities and Public Policy setting?
### R is very versatile; it can be used in a variety of settings (cf. specialized tools for specific purposes)
### R is open source and free

---
# How might you use R?

### If you're new to R and/or coding, this may look like overload- But! This is a good starting point for you.

--

### Everything I'm doing you'll be able to reproduce on your own

Things I won't be able to show:

Intro to the R language itself
We don't have the time, so learn by tweaking my code
RMarkdown (using R to produce complete documents or slides)
Text analysis in R
R offers powerful packages! Links at the end of this workshop

# R is a calculator
```{r}
1 + 1
```
# R is an object-based language

```{r}
students <- 16
papers <- 3
papers_to_grade <- students * papers
papers_to_grade
```
---

#Try for yourself!
How many papers would you have to grade if you were teaching two instead of one section?

```{r}
students <- 16
papers <- 3
classes <- 2
papers_to_grade <- students * papers * classes
papers_to_grade
```

# R can be extended by using one of 12,621 packages

See (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)

# Install packages once, load them each time
For data input/output:
```{r}

#Example 1: Data from the CIA World Factbook (2014), prepared by OpenIntro Statistics

---


```{r}
cia <- read_csv("cia_factbook.csv")
#glimpse(cia)
#View(cia)
```

---

# Life expectancy
```{r}
ggplot(data = cia, aes(x = life_exp_at_birth)) + geom_histogram()
```

---
#Try for yourself!
How is the net migration rate distributed?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cia, aes(x = net_migration_rate)) + geom_histogram()
```

---
#Life expectancy -> more emigration?

```{r,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cia, aes(x = life_exp_at_birth, y = net_migration_rate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = country))
```


---
#Let's un-clutter this:
```{r,warning=FALSE}
filter(cia, net_migration_rate > 20 | net_migration_rate < -20)
```

---
#Let's un-clutter this:

```{r,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cia, aes(x = life_exp_at_birth, y = net_migration_rate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(data = filter(cia, net_migration_rate > 20 | net_migration_rate < -20), aes(label = country), vjust = "inward", hjust = "inward")
```

---
## Are the two variables related?

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5}
ggplot(data = cia, aes(x = life_exp_at_birth, y = net_migration_rate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(data = filter(cia, net_migration_rate > 20 | net_migration_rate < -20), aes(label = country), vjust = "inward", hjust = "inward") + 
  geom_smooth()
```

## How does internet access vary around the world?
I could use internet_users, but the raw number is bad for comparison. So let's divide by population:
```{r ,warning=FALSE}
cia <- mutate(cia, 
              internet_users_perc = internet_users / population * 100)
```
---
## How does internet access vary around the world?


```{r}
ggplot(data = cia, aes(x = internet_users_perc)) + geom_histogram()

```



---

## Higher life expectancy -> more internet access?

```{r}
ggplot(data = cia, aes(x = life_exp_at_birth, y = internet_users_perc)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

---

##Let's improve this plot!

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cia, aes(x = life_exp_at_birth, y = internet_users_perc)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_text(data = filter(cia, internet_users_perc > 90 | life_exp_at_birth > 85), aes(label = country), vjust = "inward", hjust = "inward") + 
  xlab("Life expectancy at birth") + 
  ylab("% of population with internet access") + 
  labs(title = "Countries with higher life expectancy have more internet access",
       subtitle = "... but this trend applies only to countries with life expectancy of 70 years or higher",
       caption = "Source: CIA World Factbook")
```

---
# Try for yourself!
### How would you plot internet access against population growth (population_growth_rate)?

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cia, aes(x = population_growth_rate, y = internet_users_perc)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  xlab("Population growth rate (in percentage points)") + 
  ylab("% of population with internet access")
```
---
# Identify the outliers

```{r}
filter(cia, population_growth_rate < -5 | population_growth_rate > 5)
```

---
# Let's try again, w/o outliers

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
cia_without_outliers <- filter(cia, population_growth_rate > -5 & population_growth_rate < 5)
ggplot(data = cia_without_outliers, aes(x = population_growth_rate, y = internet_users_perc)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  xlab("Population growth rate (in percentage points)") + 
  ylab("% of population with internet access")
```

---
## Visualize data on a map
First, use the built-in map tools in ggplot2:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
worldmap <- map_data("world")
glimpse(worldmap)
```

---
## Clean some country names

```{r}
cia <- mutate(cia,
              country = ifelse(country == "United States", "USA", country))
cia <- mutate(cia,
              country = ifelse(country == "United Kingdom", "UK", country))
```

---
##Join CIA and map data
```{r}
iumap <- left_join(x = worldmap, 
                   y = cia,
                   by = c("region" = "country"))
glimpse(iumap)
```


---
##First take: a chloropleth map

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = iumap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = internet_users_perc)) + 
  labs(title = "Internet usage around the world", subtitle = "% of population with internet access", caption = "Source: CIA World Factbook")

```

---
## Some improvements
Map projection
Labels
Remove Antarctica
Legend placement
```{r}
worldmap_noant <- filter(worldmap, 
                         region != "Antarctica")
iumap <- left_join(x = worldmap_noant, 
                   y = cia,
                   by = c("region" = "country"))
```

---
## Some improvements
Map projection
Labels
Remove Antarctica
Legend placement

```{r}
ggplot(data = iumap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = life_exp_at_birth)) + 
  labs(title = "Internet usage around the world", 
       subtitle = "% of population with internet access", 
       caption = "Source: CIA World Factbook",
       fill = "% of population with internet access") + 
  coord_map(projection = "rectangular", lat0 = 0, xlim = c(-180, 180)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


---
## Try for yourself:
Map migration rates around the world!

```{r echo=FALSE}
iumap <- mutate(iumap,
                net_migration_rate_scaled = plogis(net_migration_rate) - 0.5)
ggplot(data = iumap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = net_migration_rate_scaled)) + 
  labs(title = "Migration around the world", 
       subtitle = "Map shows emigration in red and immigration in blue", 
       caption = "Source: CIA World Factbook",
       fill = "Net migration (logistic transformation)") + 
  coord_map(projection = "rectangular", lat0 = 0, xlim = c(-180, 180)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", mid = "white",
  high = "blue", midpoint = 0)
```


---
## Adding locations is also easy. Let's pick capitals...
First, I scrape location data from the web (using the "rvest" package): Google points me to http://techslides.com/list-of-countries-and-capitals...


```{r}
library("rvest")
cap_url <- read_html("http://techslides.com/list-of-countries-and-capitals")
cap_nodes <- html_nodes(cap_url, "table")
cap_table <- html_table(cap_nodes[1], fill = TRUE, header = TRUE)[[1]]
glimpse(cap_table)
```

---
## Fixing a few country names and removing mini-states

```{r}
cap_table <- mutate(cap_table,
                    `Country Name` = ifelse(`Country Name` == "United States", "USA", `Country Name`))
cap_table <- mutate(cap_table,
                    `Country Name` = ifelse(`Country Name` == "United Kingdom", "UK", `Country Name`))
cia_with_caps <- left_join(x = cia, 
                   y = cap_table,
                   by = c("country" = "Country Name"))
cia_with_caps <- mutate(cia_with_caps,
                        no_ministates = ifelse(population >= 1000000, 
                                               1, 
                                               0))

```

---

## Internet access, with capitals

```{r}
ggplot(data = iumap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = internet_users_perc)) + 
  geom_point(data = filter(cia_with_caps, no_ministates == 1), 
             aes(x = `Capital Longitude`, y = `Capital Latitude`, group = NULL), 
             color = "orange", size = 1) + 
  labs(title = "Internet usage around the world", 
       subtitle = "% of population with internet access", 
       caption = "Source: CIA World Factbook",
       fill = "% of population with internet access") + 
  coord_map(projection = "rectangular", lat0 = 0, xlim = c(-180, 180)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


---
## Instead of building your own...
you can use some built-in mapping tools, too!

Let's look at some economic data for the tri-state area, using the "blscrapeR" package to pull data from the API of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
#devtools::install_github("keberwein/blscrapeR")
library("blscrapeR")
ue_tristate <- get_bls_county(stateName = c("Pennsylvania", "New Jersey", "Delaware"))
glimpse(ue_tristate)
```

# Example 2 : #oscarssowhite
What do we know about diversity among Academy Award winners over time?

I use data provided by Crowdflower/FigureEight: https://data.world/crowdflower/academy-awards-demographics
```{r}
##aa <- import("Data/crowdflower-academy-awards-demographics/data/oscars_demographics_dfe.csv")
aa<-read_csv("Oscars-demographics-DFE.csv")
glimpse(aa)
```

---
## Which awards are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(aa$award)
```

---
## AA winners overall

```{r}
ggplot(data = aa, aes(x = race_ethnicity)) + geom_bar()
```

---
## AA winners over time
First, collapse the data:

```{r}
aa_year <- summarize(group_by(aa, year_of_award, race_ethnicity),
                     awards = n())


```


---
## AA winners over time
Then, create the plot:
```{r}
ggplot(data = aa_year, 
       aes(x = year_of_award, y = awards, color = race_ethnicity)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ylim(0, NA)
```

---
## More recent trends since 1960

```{r}

ggplot(data = filter(aa_year, year_of_award >= 1960), aes(x = year_of_award, y = awards, fill = race_ethnicity)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  ylim(0, NA) 

#scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#remotes::install_github("jhelvy/renderthis")
library(renderthis)
to_pdf(from = "R4SS.Rmd")

to_gif(from = "R4SS.Rmd")
```
